# Machine-Learning-Based-Low-Cost-Multispectral-Sensor-for-Leaf-Nitrogen-and-Phosphorus-Level-Classification
 #In this project a low-cost, quick-read multispectral sensor array a developed to predict N and P level in leaves non-invasively. 
#The proposed device can capture the reflectance data at 12 different wavelength. We conducted the experiment on canola, corn, soybean and wheat leaves, subjected to varying levels of N and P fertilization. 
#For classification, KNN, SVM, decision tree, bagged ensemble tree algorithm were employed to model the reflectance data. 
#Validation was performed by 5-fold cross validation and hold out method
